  /*The box-sizing CSS property sets how the total width and height of an element is calculated.*/
  /*The width and height properties include the content, padding, and border, but do not include the margin.*/
  /*border-box tells the browser to account for any border and padding in the values you specify for an element's width and height. If you set an element's width to 100 pixels, that 100 pixels will include any border or padding you added, and the content box will shrink to absorb that extra width. This typically makes it much easier to size elements.*/

What is the flex property a shorthand property for?
What is it doing here? 
flex is shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis
here it is setting flex grow to 0, flex shrink to 0, and flex basis to 400px. 
flex grow is the size relatives to other, flex shrink shrinks them relative to others, and flex basis 
defines the size of an element before the remaining space is distributed.
