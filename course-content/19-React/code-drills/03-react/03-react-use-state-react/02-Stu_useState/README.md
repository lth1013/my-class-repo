# useState

In this activity we will practice using the useState hook in React.

## Instructions


- Run `npm i` to download all the required node modules.

- Start the application in dev mode by running `npm start` in your terminal.

- Open your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and study the rendered application.

- Update this application to accomplish the following:

- In `pages/Signup/index.js`, replace `NAME_HERE` and `PASSWORD_HERE` with code that will display both the name and password.

- The state of the Signup component should be handled by the useState Hook.

- When the value of an input field changes, the state should update, causing the component to render.

- Upon form submission, the `handleSubmit` method should `console.log` the username and password.
